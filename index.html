              A teacher often has many roles to play in a students life. They
              ignite the spark to follow their passion, teaches them the
              difference between right and wrong and if needed help them to
              overcome all the challenges like a true friend.

            <h2>Why Teachers' Day is celebrated?</h2>
            <p>
              September 5th is celebrated as Teacher's Day in India to mark the
              birth anniversary of Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, an Indian
              philosopher, academic, and statesman, who served as the first Vice
              President and Second President of independent India. He was born
              on September 5the 1888 in Tirutani in a middle-class family. Right
              from childhood, Dr Radhakrishnan was an incredible student. Upon
              finishing his education he took the role of a teacher and
              dedicated his life to education. Despite all his accomplishments
              and contributions, Radhakrishnan remained a teacher throughout his
              life. He always encouraged the youth to take a step forward in
              shaping the world with the power of education. It was at his
              request his birthday was celebrated as the Teachers' day across
              India since 1962. He said, "Instead of celebrating my birthday, it
              would be my proud privilege if September 5 is observed as
              Teacher's Day."
